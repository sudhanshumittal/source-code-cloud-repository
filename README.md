<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>
The project was built as part of CS345 course at IIT Guwahati. The aim of the project was to get hands on experience of designing, creating a database. The schema was <b>normalized</b> to reduce redundancy with seriously impacting query counts.    
This project intends to provide a platform for users to upload and maintain their projects with ease and efficiency. Users can collaborate and review each others projects seamlessly. The platform is supplemented with optimized queries for fast information retreival from the database.  
The UI uses twitter bootstrap and allows easy navigation</p>
